/*
Note: the difference between regular and asymmetric enemies relates only to their detection behaviour. Either will work similarly but with the following differences:
Regular enemies will share your identity between all units of that side after a short while once you become compromised, making it more important to have quick, clean kills.
Asymmetric enemies on the other hand will be able to detect your true identity from further away due to their local knowledge, but won't necessarily share your identity with other cells.
In essence, you can get closer to regular enemies without blowing your cover but once blown, it will stay blown for longer.

//-------------------------Disguise settings-------------------------
/*
Disguises allow the player and his subordinates to pose as non-hostiles as long as they don't act suspiciously.
Safe items are items that you can wear and not blow your cover.
Be aware though that the script is geared more towards undercover work dressed as civilians and will currently penalise anyone carrying a weapon.
If you are seen carrying military equipment (weapons, grenades, explosives, NVGs, binoculars / laser designators), it will blow your disguise.
Having night vision goggles strapped to your head will blow your disguise too, even if you aren't actually using them!! (This can be turned off below).

//-------------------------Civilian recruitment settings-------------------------
/*
By enabling civilian recruitment, undercover can recruit any ambient civilians they see into their group (if their reputation allows / the civvy wants to join).
Civilians will operate under similar restrictions to the player; if they are armed, conducting hostile actions, or seen wearing prohibited gear, their cover will be blown.
If your civilian teammate has a concealed weapon in their uniform or backpack, you can order them to get it out by using the action orders menu (command menu -> 6).
If they are armed and have space to hide a weapon in their uniform or backpack, you can order them to conceal their weapon using the same action menu.
You can also dismiss your new teammates and they will leave your group and carry on doing whatever it is they fancy doing (usually sitting cross-legged in the middle of a field).
