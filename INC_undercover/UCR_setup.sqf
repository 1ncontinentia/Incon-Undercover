By enabling civilian recruitment, undercover can recruit any ambient civilians they see into their group (if their reputation allows / the civvy wants to join).
Civilians will operate under similar restrictions to the player.
You can also dismiss your new teammates and they will leave your group and carry on doing whatever it is they fancy doing (usually sitting cross-legged in the middle of a field).
